# Predicting-Employee-Attrition


Project ID: #CC69856
Internship Domain: Data Science Intern
Project Level: Intermediate
Assigned By: CodeClause Internship

📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition (turnover) is a major challenge for organizations. It results in the loss of valuable talent, higher hiring costs, and reduced productivity.

This project builds a machine learning classification model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on HR data.

🎯 Aim

To develop a model that predicts the likelihood of employee attrition in a company.

📖 Description

Dataset used: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset

Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand employee trends.

Apply data preprocessing: handle categorical variables, scale features.

Train machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier).

Evaluate performance using:

Accuracy

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Confusion Matrix (visualized)

Plot Feature Importance to identify key factors contributing to attrition.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (ML Modeling & Metrics)

Jupyter Notebook (VS Code extension)

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository or download the project folder.

Open the folder in VS Code.

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Open notebook.ipynb and run all cells.

📊 Results

Model Accuracy: ~80–85% (Random Forest Classifier)

Key Insights:

Features like Monthly Income, Overtime, Age, Daily Rate, Total Working Years strongly influence attrition.

Work-life balance and job satisfaction also play a role.

🔮 Future Scope

Test with advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or Neural Networks.

Deploy as a web application using Flask/Streamlit for HR teams.

Add real-time prediction support with live employee data.
